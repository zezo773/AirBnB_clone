# 🌐 Web Static — AirBnB Clone

This folder holds all the **static web files** (HTML, CSS, images, fonts) used to create the front-end interface of the AirBnB Clone project.  
It represents how the final website will look before being connected to the back-end.

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory is dedicated to building the **front-end** for the AirBnB Clone project.  
It allows you to:

- Practice web design using **HTML5** and **CSS3**  
- Understand how to structure a website’s static layout  
- Create pages that will later connect to the back-end through a web framework  

---

## 🧩 Features

- Clean HTML5 structure  
- Reusable CSS components  
- Responsive design ready for future enhancement  
- Organized file structure for scalability

## ⚙️ How to View

1. Clone the main repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zezo773/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```
2. Move into the `web_static` directory:
   ```bash
   cd AirBnB_clone/web_static
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:

   firefox index.html
   # or
   google-chrome index.html
   ```

You’ll see the initial front-end design for the AirBnB Clone project.

## 💡 Tips for Development

- Keep your code **well-indented and readable**  
- Use **classes and semantic tags** to improve structure  
- Test your layout in multiple screen sizes  
- Store your styles in `css/` and link them properly in HTML  
- Use consistent file naming (e.g. `header.png`, `logo.svg`)  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

You can expand this static part with:
- JavaScript interactivity (create a `js/` folder)
- Animation or transitions using CSS
- A responsive navigation bar
- Integration with Flask or any back-end later

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Stick to relative paths (avoid absolute URLs)  
- Compress your images for better performance  
- Validate your HTML/CSS with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  
- Follow a consistent color palette
